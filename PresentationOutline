Story:	
	Opening:
		- App to pay off debt, lots of finance apps out there but none specifically to paying off debt.
		- So lets get at it.  To not bore you with the signup process, I have two volunteers from an
			office I use to work at willing to show off their results.
	BULK:
		- Here is our first volunteer Michaelss Snapshot and as you can see, he's going to be in debt 
			for a while.
		- He notices his total balance, his estimated payoff date, he can use the graph to see
			his balance after a certain amount of months and can see what types hold the balance.
		- Now that Michael sees how long he can pay everything off, he needs a little help in knowing
			what to pay.  Luckily he has this handy monthly schedule updated for him every month
		- You know what though, in looking over the schedule, Michael forgot to add his Sandals
			VISA account so he goes to add the account (ADD ACCOUNT 6000, 150, 18.99)
		- Show updated totals and schedule.
		- Now Michael is a little less stress knowing if he sticks to the updated schedule, he
			won't be in debt forever.
		- Now, lets take a quick look at Jim's account, who's a little more financially responsible.
		- Notice how he'll be out of debt sooner and has less fluxuasion in his graph due to his good
			credit and low interest rates.
		- Jim notices that he made a mistake when entering his name earlier (show name change)
		- Lastly, Jim would like to see what effects paying more monthly would have, rather than putting
			it to savings (lower savings and up payable).
		- Show the changes.
		- So as you can see, different people with different financial situations can both benefit
			from the Debt LineUp.
		- Thank you.

	Closing:
		- In closing, you can see that The Debt LineUp is not just for those who need financial help, 
			but for anyone that could use the information provided.
